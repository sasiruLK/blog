browsers.\n\nReact Developer Tools for Chrome\nReact Developer Tools for Firefox\nReact Developer Tools for Microsoft Edge\n\nOnce you have the extension installed, you'll see there is a new tab in your developer tools called ⚛️ Profiler. You can change the settings to record an explanation of why each component re-rendered in in the recording.\nYou can also have it highlight the parts of the DOM that re-render while you're kicking the tires on your application. Go in to the settings for the profiler and select \"Highlight updates when components render.\"\nThis will get your a fun green rectangle around anything that is going through a re-render as you interact with your application.\nReact rendering cycle\n\nReact starts at the root of the component tree and works its way downward in hopes of finding all of the components that need updating. It does this by calling each component with its current props and looking at the output to determine if anything has changed.\nOnce React has worked its way through the entire component tree, it compares this new tree to the current state of the world and figures out what it needs to do the DOM in order to get everything up to date.\nRendering is not the same as updating the DOM. You could render a component and have the results be exactly the same as it was last time, which means that we don't need to update the DOM.\nPhases\n\n\nRender phase is where we render everything and calculate all of the changes that we need to do in order to get everything up to date.\nCommit phase is where React goes ahead and makes those aforementioned changes to the DOM.\n\nAfter React has updated the DOM, it updates all of the `ref`s to make sure they're pointing to the correct DOM nodes.\nNext up, it synchronously runs theuseLayoutEffect hooks.\nOnce this is all behind us, we move into the Passive Effects phase React then lets go on the main thread for a moment and pops a short timeout on the event loop before running all of the useEffect hooks.\n\n\n\nReact 18 introduced concurrent rendering, which brought with it features like useTransition.\nThe high-level is that this gives React the ability to pause work in the rendering phase to allow the browser to handle events. After it does this, React steps back in. Depending on what went down, it will either resume, throw away, or recalculate that work later. The commit phase then goes down as normal.\nTo my previous point about how rendering might not result in needing any updates to the DOM.\nOn Rendering\nIn order to kick off the render phase, one of the following has to go down:\n- The state is updated via either the useState or useReducer hooks.\n- Then calls a ReactDOM.Root's render method again.\n- The useExternalSyncStore hook is called.\nBy default, a parent component renders, React will work its way down the component tree re-rendering all of the child components. It doesn't care if the props changed. The only requirement that React cares about is whether or not the parent component rendered, that enough to get a child component re-rendered. Now, that doesn't mean that the DOM is going to need to be updated in anyway, but this is how React comes that conclusion.\nOn Committing\n\nReact calls the following during the commit phase: useLayoutEffect. But, it's important to note that it calls these hooks before it has had a chance to paint.\nThe browser won't paint anything while JavaScript is executing and blocking the event loop. It'll wait for you to finish. This is why React runs all of these synchronously.\nFibers\n\nReact keeps track of all of the current component instances. One of the core pieces of this data structure called a fiber, which have been around since React 16. When a component is rendered for the first time, React goes ahead and creates a fiber object to track the component instance. React stores all of the hooks for a component as a linked list attached to that component's fiber.\nFibers are in charge of answering the following questions:\n- What type of component are we expecting at this point in the component tree? Was it a div last time and now its a span? Well, then we probably need to reconcile that.\n- What are the current props and state associated with this component instance?\n- Who are its parents, siblings, and children?\nTo the first bullet point, if React sees that a component type has changed, it will try to optimize for the likely scenario that this is a fundamentally different tree from this point forward and it will just toss the entire sub-tree out and start over. This is where doing crazy stuff like dynamically defining components inside of another one can get you into trouble. This will be a different component in memory and it will cause React to take drastic measures.\nAvoiding expensive state initialization\n\nLet's say that you have some expensive function that you need to call in order to initialize your component or application.\n\nYour component is a function that is called every render. This means you're going to call expensiveFn() every time. And you know what? It's expensive.\nAn alternative approach is to pass the useState a function to tell it how to initialize itself the first time\n\nuseState will call that function the first time it sets up state and setState and that's it.\nReducing renders\n\nPushing State Down &amp; Pulling State Up\n\nDan Abramov well explained this on his blog. So I don't want to write about this. You can find the article here.\nSome more tools\n\nReact has hooks to help\n\nuseMemo lets you cache the result of a calculation(a value basically) between re-renders.\nuseCallback lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.\n\nLet's check the function below.\n\nSo the thing here is we're re-creating these functions on every render. Above is an anonymous function each an every time and it's a different object in memory from the last time we whipped up a function.\nBut, things get a little bit trickier. We could try to wrap these functions in useCallback.\n\nIt technically works, but it doesn't exactly do us a lot of good. The problem is that todos is really the only thing we're ever dealing with in this application and it's basically changing every time we do anything.\nReact will automatically pass the current version that you were working with when it goes to update the state. This mean, you don't need to pass a reference to it.\nSo what you could do is\n\nContext\n\nSo let's say if you want to use context\n\nNow every children components are going to re-render every time state change. So the problem is we are putting state in a brand new object. That brand new object is not the same as previous one. Items or dispatch might be the same but the object is new. So it invalidates the useMemo or useCallback checks if you put those.\nSo what's the solution here ?\nTwo contexts\nOne context create our problem. So Two context is our way out. One for the things that change. One for the things that don't change.\n\nContext order is important here. We have to put the one that doesn't change outside of one that change.\nNote From Dan\n\nNever thought Dan himself would comment about my blog post, But here we are!\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/sasiru.lk/post/3kl6quo5v472f\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/how-did-i-optimized-react-apps/","title":"Understanding React Rendering and Re-renders"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-astro-to-zola/":{"body":"Journey with Astro\n\nAfter I got to know about Astro a few years ago, I thought this was the best way to create a blog. So I created my blog, and I remember I changed the theme every once in a while without writing any blog posts. In 2022, I was determined to write a blog post and, at the time, was really interested in how this modern frontend framework works behind all this, especially React. I came across these two websites Build Your Own React and Create a Frontend Framework, and learned a lot from those. I highly recommend that you read them too. Then I created this blog post about optimizing React with the knowledge that I gathered. To date, that's the only blog post I wrote, but I am proud of what I did.\nUp until then, I was a full-stack developer, mostly working on Node.js and React/Vue.js frameworks. Then I had a big accident and had to rest for a while. While spending most of my time in bed, I wanted to learn Go, so I started learning it, and after a while, I was fortunate enough to find a remote job to work on Go. Then I was solely focused on backend API development. Recently, the project we were building, we wanted to rewrite in Rust. I started to learn Rust. After spending time learning Rust at work, I naturally hit the point every Rust programmer hits: “Why not rewrite my blog in Rust?” It’s like a secret Rust club ritual — first your APIs, then your blog, and eventually even your shopping list. It showed me a few options, but I liked Zola because out of all of them, Zola had good documentation.\nProblems I faced with astro\n\nAstro is a good framework that is easy to work with, but it comes with some challenges related to the npm ecosystem. Since I only had a one-page blog, I didn’t encounter many issues. However, for a blog with just one post, the build time was surprisingly high. I faced this problem frequently when migrating to a new laptop or installing a new operating system. Whenever I cloned my repository and tried to run npm install, it caused some issues that prevented it from working properly. While these issues were minor compared to the benefits Astro provides—such as the ability to implement beautiful UI elements with engaging interactions—maintaining a markdown blog with it proved to be more trouble than it was worth.\nPerformance Difference\n\nI wanted to compare the performance of Zola and Astro, so I created a bash script to measure build time, production build size, and memory usage of the development server. Here are my findings:\nFrameworkBuild TimeOutput SizeDev Server Memory\nAstro3.703s16M73.61 MB\nZola0.055s644K42.96 MB\n\n\nBuild Time: Zola is approximately 67 times faster than Astro.\nOutput Size: The build output from Zola is about 25 times smaller than that of Astro.\nDevelopment Server Memory Usage: Zola uses around 42% less memory than Astro.\n\nIf you want to know how I calculated the data, this is the shell script I wrote in my GitHub Gist\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      \n\n    \n    Note\n  \n  \n    Please note that these results were generated on my personal laptop.\n\n  \n  \n\n\nConclusion\n\nI initially moved to Zola because I transitioned from being a full stack developer to focusing more on backend development with Go and Rust. This shift resulted in shorter build times and eliminated Node.js dependency issues..\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-astro-to-zola/","title":"Why I Migrated My Blog from Astro to Zola"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/about/":{"body":43,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/how-did-i-optimized-react-apps/":{"body":679,"title":5},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-astro-to-zola/":{"body":308,"title":4}},"length":5},"lang":"English"}
