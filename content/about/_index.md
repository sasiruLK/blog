Hi, my name is **Sasiru Ravihansa Wijendra**.  
I’m a software developer who enjoys building projects, solving problems, and sharing what I learn along the way.  

I write about coding, technology, and personal projects on this blog, [sasiru.lk](https://sasiru.lk).  
You’ll also find my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/sasiruLK), and I’m active on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/sasiruLK) and [X](https://x.com/sasiruLK).  

My goal is to grow as a developer, contribute to open-source, and connect with a global community of engineers and creators.
