Hi, I’m **[Sasiru]** — a developer who spends a bit too much time digging into how things actually work.

I write about programming because I enjoy peeling back the abstractions and figuring out *why* things behave the way they do. That usually means diving into language internals, compiler quirks, framework behaviors, and other deep-in-the-weeds topics.

When I’m not reverse-engineering some obscure edge case or writing blog posts about Go, Rust, or TypeScript, you’ll usually find me:

<!-- - building small tools to solve problems that don’t exist yet,
- or reimplementing something in Rust. -->

Outside of code, I enjoy reading, writing and hagout with my friends.
