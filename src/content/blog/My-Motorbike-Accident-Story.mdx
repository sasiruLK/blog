Introduction

A year ago, I was in an accident that I've been wanting to write about, but it's been quite challenging. I'm not a great writer, and it's really painful to even think about. However, today I've decided to write about it for my documentation and in the hope that it might help someone else going through a similar situation feel more understood and supported.

The accident

It's March 31, 2023, and my boss Keith came from Australia for his vacation. However, Keith is known for working during his vacations, and this time, his vacation spot is in Sri Lanka. He invited Kosala, and Waqar to his place in Borella to work together. I was responsible for developing the company website and its associated services, while Waqar had ideas about marketing. Keith and Kosala explained to me the meaning of the services and how they should function. Since I lived in Gampaha, about 30km away, I started my scooter on the morning of the 31st and went to Keith's place to work with him.

A few hours later, Waqar and Kosala joined us to work. Some other employees were working with Keith, but he wanted to work with the four of us together on the first day. After finishing our work, he treated us to dinner at the Monarch Imperial. We all went there for dinner, and from Keith's place, Waqar, Kosala, and Keith went in Keith's car, while I rode my bike to the Monarch Imperial. It was a great night; we ate a lot, and they drank a lot (I'm the only non-alcoholic). I accidentally ate cuttlefish, not realizing I was allergic to seafood. Kosala immediately took me to the nearest pharmacy and got me some medication. We also met an old colleague, Hiruni, and her husband. Around 9:30 PM, Amasha left, saying it was late for her. After saying goodbye, I started my scooter. Suddenly, I remembered to call my father because I had asked him to bring me some medication. After calling him, he said he didn't need to bring it, and advised me to use the main roads since it was late. I also informed my girlfriend that I was leaving and shared my location with her.

As I started riding after a long time, I came to a junction called Miriswatta, which is 2.5km from my home and is a 4-way junction. As I approached the junction, there were two traffic signals that I needed to pass. The first one was to go straight, and the second one was to turn right to go home. I passed the first one and waited for the second one to turn green. There were a few people ahead of me, so I waited, and finally, it turned green. People started to go, and I started my scooter and turned right. That's all I remember.

Suddenly, I heard people shouting, and it didn't take long for me to understand that I was in a Tuk. Someone told the tuk-tuk driver to go to Gampaha Hospital, and he would surely follow him there. I started to feel a lot of pain in my stomach and my left hand. I couldn't feel my left leg. I tried to get a look at my leg because I thought it might not be there, but it was, and it was out of my control. I saw it swinging, but I didn't have the time to think about it. I felt my breath shorten and it was hard to breathe.

All of this happened very quickly. The Tuk driver talked to me while driving and asked for my parents' contact number. After a few more times, I felt we arrived at the hospital. They obediently put me onto a trolley bed and sent me to the emergency room.

I want you to understand that while all this was happening, I was in so much pain and I just couldn't find the words to describe it. I couldn't breathe and my stomach pain kept getting worse.
