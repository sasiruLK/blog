title: I have become a go developer
---

I have been a full stack developer for 4 years now. I worked on React and Node and many other in the Javascript ecosystem as I started doing it Javascript and then moved to typescript.

For a personal reason I had to quit my job year ago. I have been hoping to write this about in the future.

Last 6 months I started doing freelance work and then I needed to find a proper job.
